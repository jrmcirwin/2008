09:59:01	 From Solomon Gofere To Jesse McDevitt-Irwin(Privately) : Do you want this to be recorded?
09:59:30	 From Jesse McDevitt-Irwin To Solomon Gofere(Privately) : Yes please
09:59:49	 From Jesse McDevitt-Irwin To Solomon Gofere(Privately) : :)
10:02:11	 From Florian Grosset : If you want to live inside art too: https://www.niio.com/site/zoom-bgs/
10:03:20	 From Claire Palandri : if you want a topical zoom background, check this out (made by an undergrad student)
10:03:33	 From Florian Grosset : Nice thanks Claire!
10:05:00	 From Claire Palandri To Jesse McDevitt-Irwin(Privately) : can’t mess with your whatsapp
10:05:10	 From Claire Palandri To Jesse McDevitt-Irwin(Privately) : so gonna distract you here
10:10:58	 From Anna Papp : This interactive graph is so cool!
10:11:13	 From Andrew Wilson (he/him) : agreed!
10:20:35	 From Florian Grosset : In the motivation/literature, this recent WP by Lucie Gadenne and co might be of interest: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_PrCdZPoGkcssULzFGyI_41hmA2QqQfw/view(showing that in-kind transfers can be preferred to cash transfers because of such price shocks)
10:27:38	 From Matthew Harrington To Jesse McDevitt-Irwin(Privately) : Alternative explanation?: Government more heavily taxing to offset revenue losses and reallocating towards urban centers?
10:27:47	 From Matthew Harrington To Jesse McDevitt-Irwin(Privately) : Sorry ignore that
10:52:06	 From Florian Grosset : I'm missing the cashew sauce
10:54:40	 From Florian Grosset : Two quick questions for later (to let you move on): * Can you look at heterogeneity by job of the parents (i.e., whether they buy food or sell food)?* Can there be differential death of children, so you would have a sample selection because you're only looking at surviving infants?
10:57:59	 From Matthew Harrington : You're being a little tough on yourself though.  Infant hemoglobin is linked to important health outcomes right? Likewise lower level of iron in the mother are probably correlated with serious implications on their health as well. Maybe those aspects aren't causal, but highly correlated
10:58:38	 From Florian Grosset : Could you compare the perception of people in Senegal and of government officials and of FOA/UN people?
10:59:20	 From Florian Grosset : (Gustav Kalm, in anthropology, does cool stuff on mining where he compares what people near the mines think and what international lawyers involved in the project think -- and how those viewpoints interact)
11:00:01	 From Tarikua Erda : gotta run. thanks for the great talk, Jesse, and good luck!
11:00:33	 From Florian Grosset : Related to Josephine's point on identification, can breastfeeding be endogenous to the shock? (i.e., whether infant formula, breastfeeding, or something else -- ans so again you get some sample selection)
11:01:57	 From Claire Palandri : +1 Florian (on breastfeeding), thought the same
11:03:34	 From Matthew Harrington : Great talk, bye!
11:10:14	 From Anna Papp : Thanks Jesse, really interesting talk!
11:10:24	 From Solomon Gofere To Jesse McDevitt-Irwin(Privately) : Have to run, thanks Jesse. You’re the host now.
