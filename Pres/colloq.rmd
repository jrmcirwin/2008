# Background

```{r}
fao %>% filter(Crop == "Cereals") %>% mutate(date = paste0(Date,"-01")) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date,
         format = "%Y-%m-%d")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date,y=Price))+geom_path()+
  labs(title = "FAO Cereal Price Index: 1990-2020 monthly",
       x = "Month: Jan 1990 = 1",

```

## The Case of Senegal

Senegal:

* Small, relatively open economy;
* Large urban center of Dakar;
* Horticulture and irrigated rice near the coast;
* Hinterland producing rainfed groundnuts, maize and local cereals.

--

Of interest for this project because:

* Imports much of its food supply;
* 50% urban, whose majority of calories come from rice; and,
* Broader issue of vulnerability to climate change vs market shocks.

--

And has the right data.

```{r  dakar time-series}
load("~/Research/MA Thesis/Anemia/data/price_time_series.Rdata")
prices <- prices %>% mutate(Date = as.Date(DATE,format = "%Y-%m-%d"), Region = City) %>% filter(Date<"2015-01-01")

ggplot(filter(prices, City=="World"|City=="Dakar"), aes(x=DATE, y=Price, color= Region))+geom_path()+ theme(legend.title=element_text())+
labs(title = "World and Dakar Prices of Rice: 2007-2020", x ="Year", y= "Price: USD/kg", caption = "Data from the FAO.")

# Motivation

class: center,middle

<blockquote>
The phase of economic development after the emergence of a large class of wage labourers but before the development of social security arrangements is potentially a deeply vulnerable one.  <hr> Amartya Sen, 1981:173.

## Existing work

* Anthropologists, journalists and researchers in food-policy and nutrition have no hesitation recognizing:
	- Large, negative effects of the 2008 price increase;
* Economists: 


--

```{r, out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/friend/Images/ld.gif")
```

---

## Existing work

* Economists:
	- The _net_ effects on poverty seem to have been small (urban loss offset by rural gain) (Akshay et. al. 2008; Dimova et. al. 2012);
* Limited causal evidence on health effects due universal nature of exposure.


```{r, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/friend/Images/dimova.png")
```

---


## Contribution

* First well-identified (🤞) estimates of health effects from 2008 crisis;
* Implicit evidence of long-term damage to cognitive development.

--

## Why I like it


1. Income effects of the 2008 crisis are smaller welfare effects because of credit constraints-- health is a better measure!
2. Price-based crises are of increasing importance due to:
	- Demographic transition;
	- Agrarian transition.
3. Opportunity to bridge two schools of thought:
	- Agrarian political economy (based on class analysis); and,
	- Deaton-style household economics (based on consumer theory).

# Theory

---

## Effect of Food Price Shock 

Two, opposing effects of an increase in food prices:
	
1. Decrease in purchasing power for _buying_ food;
2. Increase in revenue from _selling_ food.

Net-effect depends on the net position of the household (Deaton, 1997).


---

## Deaton Curve

```{r}
#Here I will use a whiteboard, draw curve, discuss different societies.
#discuss climate change mainly affecting right hand side
#agrarian transition is perhaps good news for climate change impacts, but brings new forms of vulnerability
```

.pull-left[
## Agrarian Transition

* Commodification of agriculture;
* Shift from subsistence to commercial production;

## Demographic Transition

* Death rates decrease faster than fertility;
* Leads to demographic "bulge";
* Rural population growth generally leads to:
	- Agricultural intensification;
	- Reduction in land-per-person; and,
	- Rural-to-urban migration.

#Here I will use a whiteboard, draw figure of venn diagram, three types of vulnerabilty, four different classes
```

## Models of Development

Within Senegal, tension between two models:

1. Agricultural intensification + Urbanization:
	- E.g. Large-scale rice farms increase production shedding labor.
2. Labor-absorbing agro-ecology.

Model (1) pushes the agrarian transition while (2) follows a different path.

---

## Credit Constraints

Credit constraints:

1. Prevent households from smoothing shocks across time;
2. Making the optimized utility function function more concave;
3. Imply that a gain for one household from a price shock is _less valuable_ than an equivalent the loss for another.

---

```{r}

x <- data.frame(c(10:500)/300)
colnames(x) <- "x"
x$`Credit Constrained` <- log(x)+log(1)+10
x$`Smoothed` <- 2*log(x/2 +.5)+10

x %>% pivot_longer(cols = 2:3) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x=x,y=value$x,color = name))+geom_path()+
labs(x = "Income in Period 1", y= "Optimized Utility") + theme(legend.position = "none") 
```


---


## Summary of Motivation

* Severity of the 2008 crisis is debated in the literature;
* Little direct evidence on physical well-being;
* Credit constraints suggest that changes in income will not be equivalent to changes in well-being;
* The ongoing agrarian and demographic transitions push subsistence farmers into the following classes (CIRAD 2017):
	- commercial farming;
	- agricultural laborers;
	- urban laborers.
* Each of which are more vulnerable to food price shocks than subsistence farmers.

# Empirical Challenges

class: center,middle 

<br>

<blockquote>
One objective of statistical modeling is to create an analogy, perhaps forced, between an observational study and an experiment.  <hr> David Freedman, 2007.
</blockquote>

## Exposure and Insulation

Problem: 

* Everyone was exposed to the 2008 shock.

Solution: 

* Find a group who were _insulated_ in terms of a specific physiological process.

I.e. find an infant bio-marker for maternal malnutrition.

--

Introducing infant hemoglobin!

---

## Exposure and Insulation

For identification, two key points:

1. Maternal iron nutrition determines fetal iron accumulation, which carries through to infancy (Camaschella, 2015);
2. Infant iron accumulation is independent of maternal iron consumption, __during exclusive breastfeeding__.

Hemoglobin is of particular interest because:

* Iron is a critical nutrient in cognitive development (Lozoff and Georgieff, 2006);
* Iron consumption depends on _quality_ of diet, as well as quantity.

## Data

DHS Senegal: 

* repeated cross-section, 2005,2008,2010, yearly from 2012-2019;
*  2010 survey observes children born around the crisis around 2 years old;
*  Household characteristics of interest:
	-  Wealth index;
	-  Urban/rural;
	-  Land-ownership;
	-  Location.

---

## Summary of Empirical Strategy

* The effect of the 2008 crisis is difficult to identify because everyone was affected;
* Infant hemoglobin depends on maternal nutrition during gestation, but not during breastfeeding;
* Compare:
	- Children born just before the crisis; to,
	- Those *in-utero* during the crisis.
* Adjust for age differences.

# Interpretation

---

<blockquote>
There is an obsession in the field of economics to obtain “causal  effects,”  even  if  the  effects  being  identified  are  without  social  significance  and/or economic meaning. 	<hr>	James Heckman, 2020.

## Interpretation

The effect of the 2008 crisis on maternal-infant health in Senegal:

* Is not a structural parameter;
* Has no external validity;
* Is not the effect of a price increase;
* Is one outcome of a diverse set of mechanisms behaviors and responses on the individual, household and social level:
	- E.g. gender relations, food sharing, mutual aid, etc.

--

First step, heterogeneity of effect by:
* Urban-rural;
* Household wealth;
* Land-ownership; and,
* Region

---

## Future Research

Integrating ethnographic evidence:
* A rigorous version of "go talk to people";
* E.g. oral histories of the 2008 crisis in Senegal.

--

In order to:

* Characterize the broader phenomena, of which my empirical estimate is one aspect; and,
* Enable interpretation of the results, and formation of new narratives and hypotheses.
